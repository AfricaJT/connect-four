# connect-four
Intro to Java Programming Project

Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. This game has no GUI and is run entirely through the console of the Java IDE. The options to change between Singleplayer mode (user vs computer) or multiplayer mode (user vs user or computer vs computer) can only be changed in the Main.java file
